Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this ext",

            "Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confuse",

Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.

            "First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we’ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don’",
            "It's true I liked it less than perhaps the vast majority of _Spider-Verse's_ audience, but this was still great, the animation enamouring, and the depth of its story and reference totally engaging. Not to me the best Spider-Man movie as many have said, (that honour still goes to _Homecoming_) but a blast all the same.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._",
            "My wife doesn’t care for Spider-Man at all - as Batman is her favorite superhero.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, she loves this movie to death, along with my son and I. It’s safe to say we’ve watched this movie over 10 times and we’ve shown it to all our friends. It’s a really great movie that promotes diversity, good animation, and has a great story. I highly recommend to all who are interested in watching.",

It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. Th",

            "Everything felt cohesive. It was surprisingly hilarious in many different ways, that it became the somewhat core of the movie. Also, stay at the very end, it has a top-tier end credit scene.",
            "Finally, Miles Morales has been given the spotlight after so many renditions of the Peter Parker version of Spider-man. This movie was everything I wanted, and I hope they will have a sequel just as amazing as this one.",

Alas, I do not, but I still had a good time watching this.\r\n\r\nIt was cool seeing every department of the story come together, while the animation is definitely one of its big plus points - I enjoyed seeing it.

There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction.",

            "The epic Marvel Saga that started over ten years ago has been building up to the inevitable clash with the powerful tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin).  Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, an",
            "Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see _Endgame_ again.\r\n\r\nPutting it out there right from the get-go, _Avengers: Endgame_ is my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's so",

            "These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig.

My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in \"Infinity War\" weren’t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I’ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \"Back to the Future II\" (1989).\r\n\r\n“Endgame” (2019) begins strong ",

            "For someone who is just watching this for the sake of staying current on today's popular culture, it was okay. Not as great as the previous ones but I can kinda see why this had to take on a more dramatic tone as opposed to the usual flashy Marvel movie.",

            "The film may not have outstanding action scenes as the previous ones but it had a tremendous amount of story and depth which, to me, seems fair taking into consideration the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War.",

            "Some of the scenes were unnecessary and could've been just cut out entirely and the movie would still make sense. I expected more from this 3-hour film but it turned out to be just a complete waste of time.",
            "Loved this movie. Everybody else that's asking for more action on this film need to re-watch Infinity War and think long and hard about how much the effects of the snap can affect one's mental health. Even heroes bleed.",
            "Amazing! We have been waiting for this for so long since Iron Man started and the Avengers were created. A masterpiece that has undergone a decade in the making.",
            "I have to admit, I got so emotional all throughout the movie and some parts brought me to tears. The cast was phenomenal and I think every superhero got to have their spotlight.",
            "To be honest, I was not expecting the plot of the movie to be with time travel. The movie was great, but some parts were not explained properly and they just lumped it to just a \"quantum theory\". Overall, it appeased the masses, both Marvel and non-Marvel fans.",
            "Hands down to Stanley, the Russo Brothers, the cast and all the people behind this movie. The culmination of several movies eventually leading to this one great of a story, in the end, satisfied the forever kid in me.",
            "What a rollercoaster ride the movie Avengers: Endgame was! Even though it has some slow scenes, I was really moved by the character building, how the story was elaborately planned, and the heartbreaks that we had to endure along the way. I must say, it had an epic and emotional ending we never thought we wanted.",
            "All I can say is that this movie gave me the chills! Truly fascinating. A fitting conclusion that lives up to the hype.",
            "I was expecting a lot from the Endgame, it is a culmination of many years of MCU movies, and the plot of this movie just added more questions to the ones I had when Infinity War ended. Too many plot holes, but hopefully it can be explained in the next phase of MCU.",
            "As a Marvel fan, all I can say is that I am very much thrilled, and satisfied with how the Endgame turned out. The CGI was great, the story on point, and it brought back to life all the superheroes that I love.",
            "EPIC! Endgame has all that there was: comedy, drama, action, fantasy, and many more. I love how it was the finale of MCU's current generation of movies, bringing together storylines and characters from 21 previous movies. A truly wholesome experience.",
            "As much as I would love to, I don’t want the current generation of MCU's characters to end. We all loved Robert Downey's Ironman, Chris Evans’ Captain America, and they left a mark in our hearts that can never be replaced. I will root for the next phase of MCU movies, but I don’t think it will have the same allure as the first one.",

On top of the success of the Thriller album and Michael Jackson's electrifying performance at Motown 25, the short film/music video for \"Thriller\" established Jackson as an international superstar and global phenomenon. Thriller is credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment, popularizing the making-of documentary format and creating a home video market. The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture. In 2009, it became the first music video inducted into the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". \"Thriller\" was also Jackson's seventh and final U.S. Hot 100 Top 10 hit from the Thriller album. It was the first album in history to have seven U.S. Top 10s.",

Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end.

Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense.  It really does.\r\n\r\nMaverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.\r\n\r\nF",

Like most movies in the past decade or so, real originality is lacking. Seems like all there are nowadays are rehashes of older stuff. The supporting cast is lackluster at best.\r\nThere is nothing in this movie to get excited about. I suppose if you get drunk and need to sleep it off... go watch this movie.",

Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever.

            "Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just abov",

So, I’ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Joker” is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur’s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media i",

            "Definitely an improvement over the Whedon version and as a DC fan, enjoyed plenty of the character moments (and the addition of MM) but the story did feel off even though the film is nearly four hours long, in addition the alternate timeline part at the end felt tacked on and unnecessary. The visual effects looked like something from a video game but I can forgive that since I'd imagine it'd cost an additional $100M to make it look cleaner and more realistic.\r\n\r\nGiven what Snyder had to work wit",
            "This is DC's best so far...easily.  \r\nAlthough not flawless- there are a couple of scenes that didnt need to be included - this is the version that we needed to see.  \r\nThere is so much more time given to the characters in this, the plot is better thought out and structured, and Steppenwolf is no longer a joke.  There is actually an urgency in his battles with the JL now.  And OMG, Darkseid and Desaad look and sound boss.  \r\nThe recruitment is harder, the fight between the JL and Supes and then ",

It's got the exact same plot as the theatrical cut, but it's longer and more drawn out with unnecessary slow-motion and scenes that any editor worth their salt would have cut out (like Aquaman's Icelandic singers). And what we're left with?\r\n\r\nDarkseid gets his ass kicked and then forgets he was ever on Earth. Hardly anything spectacular.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf's armor now looks like something designed by early 90s Rob Liefeld, whic",
            "Admittedly, I don’t know as much about DC as I do about Marvel. However, I’m fairly well versed in them and the Justice League is my favorite DC team. When it was announced that DC would come out with a Justice League movie after the Avengers, I had hope...that is until I learned that they’d be doing a team movie first and individual movies afterward. This is the exact opposite of what Marvel did.\r\n\r\nDuring the production of the first movie, Zack Snyder had the incredibly unfortunate disposition",

There alot of friction from which was good and bad or bad to worse. at the end its all about personal taste.

But overall a good movie just longer.",
            "_Zack Snyder's Justice League_ is able to turn one of the worst superhero movies of all time into a fantastic film filled with great action, heart, and depth.\r\n\r\nThe original 2017 _Justice League_ cut was unbearable to watch, each line of dialogue felt out of place and extremely corny. I was physically cringing at almost every scene. These problems are completely wiped away in the Snyder Cut allowing for a more character focused and emotional telling of the dawn of the Justice League. The entire",

In the late Edo era (some decades before its end in 1868) a community is plagued by two opposing gangs who have built up a criminal empire of prostitution and gambling. Even the local officials are on the take. Into this town steps a nameless samurai (Toshiro Mifune).

His skills are sought by the two opposing headmen and he quite successfully manages to play them off against each other - and keep the peace - until one the their sons arr"

It is exquisitely and intricately animated with rich textures, gorgeous lighting, and mostly welcome character reinventions. The transition to Fascist Italy fits del Toro’s vision well, but the changes remove and alter enjoyable story elements that are surely missed. _Pinocchio_ is absolutely a contender for this year’s best-animated film, but it is a film that I hoped to adore and yet only deeply appreciate.\r\n",

It is simply stunning in all its facets, and a truly remarkable and unexpected film.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-jojo-rabbit-taika-wa",

            "Where this film may have missed the mark for some people is in its comedy, insofar as audiences expect a certain depth of humour from Waititi's films. Nevertheless, _Jojo Rabbit_ is tremendously endearing, especially through the titular character's innocent portrayal by actor Roman Griffin Davis.\r\n\r\nIts poignant ending—the last scene of which I'd rewinded about 5 times—brought a smile to my face.

When I was keeping myself abreast of this project, it seemed very much that the insinuation was that the movie would be a battle between Bale's and Damon's respective characters. That this would essentially be the run-through of the whole film, and the climax would feature one emerging victorious over the other. ",

YES, the performances are as good as the Academy says. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is one of my favorite films and I have watched it many, many times. Javier Bardem, makes an excellent screen villain, this guy is really scary, you would not want him chasing you. Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones turn in S",

            "I always figured when I got older, God would sorta come inta my life somehow. And he didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I would have the same opinion of me that he does. \r\n\r\nNo Country for Old Men is directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and the Coen's adapt the screenplay from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harelson, Javier Bardem and Kelly Macdonald. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Roger Deakins.  \r\n\r\n",
            "I watched this for the first time with a few friends as part of an ongoing movie night we shared. I think it was the most violent film we watched together. The plot is taut and somewhat riveting, with great dialogue and acting.  At the same time, for me, it seemed rather bleak. I gradually had the sense it would not end well for nearly anybody. If it weren’t for the Tommy Lee Jones character, I am not sure I would have wanted to stick with it. He provides a sort of balance in the mood of the fil",

No Country is clearly a product of the Coen Brothers' unique charm and style. It boasts some tense shoot-outs, and the uncompromising pursuit of Josh Brolin's character was fantastic.

It delivers music and voice to deaf people, highlighting important topics. **The Story:** Ruby is the only hearing person in her deaf family. They run a small business as fishermen, and she helps and supports them, mainly translating everything to her family in the deaf signs language. As a result, she splits her life between her family and her dreams.\r\nRuby discovers an incredible",

Her family live in a maritime town where the local fishermen are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet.

I have liked enough of them to make me willing to try them, but it is the exception for me to enjoy them, not the rule. So a fair action thriller is less likely to hold my attention than, say, a fair western or sci-if movie.\r\n\r\nAll that is just to say as a preamble that this movie held my attention and interest, which was all it needed to do.

            "The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards.

            "For a film that’s laser-focused on the human body, it’s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. \r\n\r\nEggs are the ‘giver of life’, right? They’re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.\r\n\r\nThat’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this ye",

It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!\r\n\r\nI think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, whi",

            "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to ",

Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like \"Fear\", \"Joy\" and \"Anger\" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark",

            "Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough!

            "When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out ",
            "\"Inside Out 2\" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\r\n\r\nThe film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions—Joy, Sadness, ",

Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.\r\n\r\nI also en"

The story is pretty basic and no real twists that we haven't seen before in the franchise, but I did like the lead actress Cailee Spaeny. The classic line, \"Getaway from her you bitch\" was delivered as great as Bale's \"I'",

While visually appealing and faithful to the oppressive atmosphere characteristic of the saga, the movie lacks a solid narrative and memorable characters.\r\n\r\nThe script relies too heavily on genre clichés, with bland dialogue and unconvincing decisions from its protagonists.

Through a thought-provoking exploration of trauma, loss, and guilt, the story’s rising emotional intensity elevates the fascinating horror elements, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience.\r\n\r\nNaomi Scott’s career-best",

The rest of the cast are good, e.g. Rosemarie DeWitt, but <em>'Smile 2'</em> is very much Scott's movie.\r\n\r\nThe run time is perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, though to be honest that is only a minor criticism in the grand scheme of things.

Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this ext",
            "People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so ",

Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic actio",
            "A vacous and imbecile action potboiler which does what it's meant to do, \"Entertain\".\r\n\r\nFast X is a noisy actioner which pushes the limits of inventive action set pieces but this time stays grounded compared to the space shit they tried last time. As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again.

            "Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how \"Dom\" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of \"Dante\" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a st",

            "I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters.

His trademark fast-forward, HFR (high frame rate) type of action doesn't appeal to many viewers, and his nonlinear narrative structure is often more confusing than captivating. At least, these are the common complaints across his filmography. While I acknowledge that these attributes don't always work, I'm actually quite a fan of his filmma",
            "Huge Jason Statham fan. But despite the trailer, this movie was far from his greatest. He's his usual cool self, but the story is weak and performance from Josh Hartnett is downright embarrassing, to say the least. Holt McCallany is decent, but in general the characters come off as two-dimensional. You really don't care about them. I panicked when I saw Jeffrey Donovan, because his appearance is seldom that impressive. He was okay though, far from the one to blame for this B-movie. It's not bad,",
            "Viewers who like action films with plenty of violence for the sake of having violence will love this movie. I can’t deny that the action grabs you by the throat and moves you along with it. Sometimes, however, it felt to me like instead of a storyboard they worked from a murderboard: “Okay, how many do we lose in this scene?”  Once again I am reminded of Hitchcock. Suspense is not a bomb going off; suspense is not knowing when or if it will explode.\r\n\r\nThey took a bit of trouble to make the plot",

Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras?

I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.\r",

Fun seeing the old guard in here with Maguire and Garfield along with their foes and at least their inclusions didn't feel as forced as I feared when this movie was first announced. The relationship between Tom Holland and Zendaya worked better than in Homecoming and even Far From Home. Will be interesting to see where the series goes from here. **4.0/5**",

            "In a wonderfully woeful world, a detective makes a sad attempt at a relationship, has the most inventive sex scene ever committed to screen, and grapples with an existential crisis as he does his work. This stuff, which could work as a standalone story, is so strong that this movie must be seen.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the movie doesn't realise that the protagonist's everyday life is the best part, and instead focuses on a larger-than-life, goofy premise meant to tie 2049 to the original and set up an",
            "Hail to the Science Fiction gods as they came to their senses and granted upon the eagerly movie-going masses the long-awaited arrival of a stunning and opulent _Blade Runner_ sequel. Perhaps we should praise the understated genius and visionary mastermind Ridley Scott for his 1982 directorial accomplishment in serving up what appeared to be an underappreciated and overlooked SF thriller in its heyday over three decades ago only for it to emerge now as one of the greatest Science Fiction futuris",
            "The film was actually rather disappointing. As a film it was OK, but as a sequel to Blade Runner, it was terrible. There were some nice in-jokes and references, but overall low-brow junk masquerading as high-brow gold (it was directed by Villeneuve, so I really shouldn't have expected better, the only thing he's good at is making stupid people think they are clever). Everything seemed forced and unnatural. The plot was trite and cliched, and everything was very predictable. Totally a wasted oppo",
            "Strikes a true balance between new and old. Denis Villeneuve has a perfect filmmaking record in my mind, and _Blade Runner 2049_ continues that trend with aplomb.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._",
            "As a movie this is a very good movie. The scenery, the acting, the colors etc. are of a very high technical standard. To me personally however, this movie is much too dark and depressing for my taste.\n\nI cannot say that I am surprised that the movie is dark. The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.\n\nAs I s",
            "I don't understand what people like in this movie. It has some good things, but nothing much to deserve such big rating. Soundtracks & atmosphere are really good & it's well shot, however story is confusing & everything is all over the place. I still didn't understand what was the whole story of movie and it is extremely slow & prolonged. Very small amount of talking & a lot observing moments. Every minor action is prolonged. Like you see man laying in the snow for a few minutes & etc... I didn'",
            "The only thing _great_ about Blade Runner 2049 is the cinematography and the Atari sign, but it was just trying to copy Blade Runner instead of a new story. Outside of that it's dog dung. The music is a poor knock off Vangelis score. The story is basically fan-service and pandering by the studio with the tons of plot holes. It includes of biblical references, and aspects from the books _Fahrenheit 451_ by Ray Bradbury, that also takes place in 2049, mixed with _1984_ by George Orwell to try to c",
            "**Overall : One of the most visually spectacular, stunning, and beautiful films I have ever seen!**\r\n\r\nNow I need to be honest; I am a simple man, and the complexities of the philosophical questions presented by the Blade Runner movies are lost on me. What makes someone truly human or real is a profound question with which an escapist like myself doesn't want to grapple. But with all that being said, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece regardless of your movie taste. The beauty of the bright neon",

He is \"K\" - working for the new but still all-powerful \"Tyrell Corporation\" tasked with eliminating the last of the \"Nexus\" generation of replicants. It's on one such mission that he, quite literally, unearths a terrible secret that could spell doom for the already crippled society of mankind. \"K\" sets out to gather as much information as he can to prevent this collapse, and gradually comes to realise that the answer might",
            "Visually stunning. That's it. It felt cold as the acting of the main character. Also it made so many assumptions on the original movie that it felt banal. Such a shame, because the concept behind could have been good, but the delivery is just not there, I'm afraid.",
            "Did it really need a sequel?\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful. I mean, it looked beautiful...even if there was one part that made me motion sick, but even that part was beautiful. And that, I think, was really more of a lighting thing than a set design thing or a special effects thing.\r\n\r\nHonestly, you remember the lighting in this. You remember it the way people remember the lighting in an Edward Hopper painting.\r\n\r\nBut did it need a sequel?\r\n\r\nThe acting was great, it really was.\r\n\r\nThere was honestly no r"

The script juggles every plot point and character moment with clarity and ease. It's funny, smart, and visually jaw dropping. Definitely lived up to the five movie hype.",
            "I give this 10 Stars based on it being not only better than the trailer and the hype made me thing it would be, but also that it was the first time anything the size and scope of the Marvel Cinematic universe was pulled off successfully. Having Joss direct this movie lives and dies on character interaction. This movie is on the definitive list in my opinion even just for that.",

The whole banding together with the death of Agent Coulson still doesn't feel right, good character but didn't think he was so beloved to be a catalyst for them. Minor point just something that stood out then, and now. Also a bit hollow given, IIRC, was alive and well for the Agents of SHIELD TV series... **4.25/5**",
            "The last hour is a lot of fun, but I found the opening chunk disappointing.\r\n\r\nI was expecting wall-to-wall action, pretty much from the start - especially given the forces that join together. However, I felt the first half of <em>'The Avengers'</em> as slow. What also didn't help is that the villain, carried over from a preceding MCU film, isn't super interesting - we also don't see the antagonist's earlier film counterpart for a fair few scenes, which felt too delayed.\r\n\r\nThe last half is much",
            "I have to say that the furore surrounding this film had pretty much doomed it to failure in my book. The Marvel marketing machine had gone into over-drive plugging it, so no way could it be any good. Well, it is good. Not great, but it is good. The compendium element of the storyline pits all of the superheroes against the mischievous \"Loki\" (a cute, curly haired, Tom Hiddleston) whom, together with his army of extraterrestrial henchmen, is bent on taking over the world... well, of course he is."

There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces ",

The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.\r\n\r\nThe surprisingly emotional screenplay helps Tom Cruise deliver ",

Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of conservatives",
            "It seems like I have been watching the trailers for this film for years now - and you know what? Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia.

            "_Top Gun: Maverick_ is a sequel that is a leaps and bounds improvement over the original film. There’s better acting from the entire cast, more of an emotional attachment between at least two of the main characters in the film, and subtle humor that actually lands.

It was most obviously written and directed with the audience in mind - no politics, no preaching, no gratuitous sex, no woke, no offensive casting or characters. Brilliant, simplistic screenwriting and thrill rides. The original, if you've seen it, was iconic as it was, and to know it makes the second film here more enjoyable, but even if you're not familiar with the background of the characters it's clearly presented enough to be a stand-alone enjoy",

It really does.\r\n\r\nMaverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.

Like most movies in the past decade or so, real originality is lacking. Seems like all there are nowadays are rehashes of older stuff. The supporting cast is lackluster at best.\r\nThere is nothing in this movie to get excited about. I suppose if you get drunk and need to sleep it off... go watch this movie.",

When I heard the familiar theme song for Top Gun, goosebumps erupted across my skin.\r\n\r\nWhile I had sky-high expectations, I confess to feeling a tinge of disappointment.

            "The young \"Furiosa\" (Alyla Browne) is captured by some rogue bikers and despite the best efforts of her sharp-shooting mother is help captive by the menacing \"Dementus\" (Chris Hemsworth) who rather paternally calls her \"Little D\"! This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The \"Immortan Joe\" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the \"Guardian of Gastown\" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the \"Bullet Farm\" - a quarry",
            "Whilst Furiosa isn't a bad action film, I suspect its lacklustre response from audiences, reflects not whats on offer but whats absent. \r\n\r\nOn the upside is loads of heart stopping action, amazing cinematic's, great sets, plus strong performances from the cast.\r\n\r\nA lesser aspect of the downside is the unnecessarily drawn out back story, replete with details about the key character, no one cares about, which, in turn, leads to the main fault in this film.......ITS NOT ABOUT MAD MAX Rockatansky.\r",
            "I enjoyed <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em>, which is a rightful addition to the <em>'Mad Max'</em> franchise.\r\n\r\nI personally would say that the run time is way too long, like this does not need to be a 2hr 20min+ movie. With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, h",
            "I really enjoyed this film! It is _a lot_ of explosions and brutality, but it was continually compelling — even as I questioned why I was so invested. At 2h20m it definitely made me feel my sleepy age (I saw it on my 39th birthday, and I was squinting and yawning by the end!) but I felt more impressed that a relatively slow paced film gripped me for so long.\r\n\r\nIt's a proper odyssey, with poor Furiosa only wanting to get home; but the trials she faces grow organically out of the plot and the uni",
            "Yeah, Furiosa. What a furious young lady. Thor does a good job. Well executed lore and world building. Sure does suck to be a lady in this wasteland. Fun to see education breakdown. Didn't even mind the runtime so maybe it should be a 10.",
            "This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especiall",
            "**Wonder Woman **\r\n\r\nLately, it seems Hollywood has been casting great actresses in strong female roles but pairing them with subpar writing. This movie is not one of those. I went in with the mindset of \"here we go again,\" but came out surprisingly satisfied. The story, acting, and action are all top-notch, and it seamlessly leads into \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" without missing a beat. Don't skip this one—it's probably the best in the franchise.",
            "There’s no doubt that “Furiosa” is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller‘s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as “Fury Road.” Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked",
            "Some decent action sequences as expected though, from my memory, doesn't come close to the epic chaos from Fury Road. The acting for the most part was fine and Chris Hemsworth seemed to be having some fun in his villain role while Anya Taylor-Joy was fine as Furiosa. However, having this coming out 9 years after Fury Road and a spin-off of a character that frankly I had little interest in, was the downfall of this prequel. Beyond that, the plot itself wasn't enthralling and at times I was pretty",

            "I do not know if I expected another woke Hollywood turd and therefore was really positively surprised or if the movie is just really good but, to me, this is a really good movie.\r\n\r\nI had heard rumblings about it being bad but, again too me, that is just not true. It is also claimed that it didn’t do as well as expected at the box office but then this is oftentimes clueless Hollywood bean counters with unrealistic and overinflated expectations causing this.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of action filled, ",
            "\"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" is enjoyable enough and George Miller is an amazing director, but the film is overlong and it does have a tendency to meander too much of the time. It is basically nothing more than a high octane succession of action scenes at its core, but don't get yourself too excited by the prospect of this. The scenes in question lack the raw excitement of the original trilogy and this is principally because most of the action is obviously taking place in the comfortable security o"

Based on a popular cyberpunk manga series by Yukito Kishiro, published between 1990-1995, he has spent that time refining the script and developing the world that Alita inhabits. And that’s pretty much what he now spends most of his time taking care of with the Avatar movies and the world of Pandora. Hence the reason why he eventually decided to step back into producer duties for this movie, letting",

It is based on a Japanese cyberpunk manga. Alita, a cyborg, is found by Dr. Ido.

            "Despite the short amount of time, it was incredible that they were able to give so much backstory to all the characters they had!",
            "It's like reading a comic book and watching a movie at the same time! Indescribable!",
            "Oh wow. I am blown away. How on Earth did an animated film such as this do so well? And how were they able to take all these separate characters and give them so much development without the film feeling like a drag.",
            "Alright. I can really tell that a lot of effort, love, and passion has been put into this film. And as with any film where creators really put a lot of soul into making, it came out really successful.",
            "SONY redeemed themselves from the flop that was the Emoji Movie, and introduced one of the most amazing Spider-Man movies of all time! The animation, the pacing, the characters, and the musical scores -- all of these were perfect! Will definitely want to watch it again and again.",
            "If Stan Lee was still alive, I bet you he is smiling right now. Incredible animation and an awesome story goes a long way. If you haven't watched this one yet, I suggest you do because you're missing out on life.",
            "The animation for this one is so on point. It is like watching a comic book come to life! The stylish way it was presented, along with the spectacular storytelling, made me love the Spider-Man that is Miles Morales more.",
            "I must say, I have doubts about this movie when it first came out because I was afraid of \"Sony\" being \"Sony\". But I’m glad I did watch it. Super solid movie with a very fulfilling Spider-Man origin story. 10/10",
            "Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse is one of the movies that when you see, you will just be left speechless and dumbfounded because of the superior animation, amazing story, and great soundtrack which you can jam with anytime.",
            "This is a MASTERPIECE! Best experience of my life so far!",
            "Stan Lee can rest easy in heaven knowing that his beloved Spidey has a very good movie now. Kudos to everyone who created this masterpiece of a movie. Excelsior!",
            "Everything felt cohesive. It was surprisingly hilarious in many different ways, that it became the somewhat core of the movie. Also, stay at the very end, it has a top-tier end credit scene.",
            "Finally, Miles Morales has been given the spotlight after so many renditions of the Peter Parker version of Spider-man. This movie was everything I wanted, and I hope they will have a sequel just as amazing as this one.",
            "I have always been a fan of Spider-man ever since I was a kid, and I must say, forget the previous renditions of Spider-man, this one IS...THE...BOMB! Watch it if you haven't seen it yet. Seriously, watch it.",
            "AESTHETICALLY PLEASING! This movie gave the \"comic book coming to life\" vibe that surely made all who were watching, Marvel fans or not, enjoy the movie till the very last second.",
            "Appealing to all ages, teaches a lot of lessons, and full of surprises! 11/10 will watch again.",
            "ONE OF THE BEST! It gave justice to our friendly neighborhood Spiderman, and all the scenes were amazing. It was like reading an animated comic book!",
            "If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on life! One of the best portrayal of Spider-Man for me, with fresh new characters and villains alike.",
            "I can see why this is highly regarded, especially if you have a connection as a comic reader. Alas, I do not, but I still had a good time watching this.\r\n\r\nIt was cool seeing every department of the story come together, while the animation is definitely one of its big plus points - I enjoyed seeing it. The voice cast all do respectable jobs too. I have no issues with this film, to be honest. I just guess there isn't anything I love about it either.\r\n\r\nShameik Moore is good in the lead, while Jak",
            "Basically, if you disliked this movie, its probably just not for your, or you just hate good movies XD\r\nHard to hate a movie when you know so much love and care was put into it. \r\n\r\nAlways found it funny how this movie was made by the same company as \"The emoji movie\".\r\n\r\nJust watch the movie, its absolutely stellar, the only thing Id hate this movie for is the fact we didnt see much of anime spooder man XD",

I find it can lead to some seriously lazy writing as inter-dimensional characterisations can write, then re-write their own pasts and futures in a fashion that can become dull and repetitive quickly. This is not one of those. It centres around \"Miles\", a young lad who likes to hang out with his wayward uncle \"Aaron\" and who has a penchant for street art.

But they did do that Modern Marvel Comics thing and turn him into an idiot screw-up in an effort to alienate the fans and somehow make Miles better by mocking Peter.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not a fan of that.

            "\"Thus Spake Zarabarbie\" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit.

It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!)

            "McKinnon and Gosling's acting is great, and the dance numbers are really well done. But the story is very weak -- the Gloria/Sasha tie-in felt ham-fisted and the 'bonding' Barbie has at the end with Ruth makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that throughout the whole movie you're being hit over the head with a message that they *really* want to make sure you understand (how many times can you say 'patriarchy'?)

Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic… As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can’t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn’t and take everything seriously. It’s not that you can’t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliant",
            "I generally really enjoy the Fast and Furious movies and was looking forward to this spin-off, especially being directed by David Leitch, but nothing in this stood out action/stunts-wise and the chemistry between Johnson/Statham/Kirby was lackluster, including the quasi-budding romance with Johnson and Kirby. A lot of this film felt forced and going in the science fiction realm just felt wrong. Sure, it's got the dumb elements F&F is known for, but very little of this was fun. **2.75/5**",
            "Yeah, sure, fuck it, why not, hey? I mean the _Fast & Furious_ franchise was already dipping into some sci-fi elements, why not just whole-hog dive into it for your spinoff? Dumb as dogshit, but might genuinely be the best thing _Fast & Furious_ has ever produced. Has cars in it, but stops bothering to try and pretend racing them is actually important to the story. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._",

Idris Elba is clearly in his element as the baddie against the F&F equivalent of dumb and dumber - Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham - who are also having fun and it is contagious. It is way, way, too long, but there is certainly some charisma on the screen and where else will you still see a bow and arrow and an axe in a fight these days?"

            "> Probably the best live-shot Cinderella I've seen.\r\n\r\nDisney has done it again. Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am gl",

David Leitch offers an experience full of action, comedy, romance, and mystery, highlighted by the impressive physical feats performed by the stunt department, mostly without the aid of visual effects.\r\n\r\nIt’s a necessary tribute to those w",
            "Undoubtedly fun, even if I did want a touch more from <em>'The Fall Guy'</em>.\r\n\r\nThe cast are great, definitely the film's strongest part in my opinion. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are an all-star pair and I enjoyed them both, they worked well together. Hannah Waddingham and Aaron Taylor-Johnson add good showings too. Stephanie Hsu and Winston Duke are involved as well.\r\n\r\nThe story produces entertainment, even if it could've had more flavour added to it. I felt watching that in a few parts it",
            "This does suffer a bit from having been trailed to death in the cinema, and the story is really pretty thin - but there's some engaging chemistry on display between the two stars as their adventures hot up. \"Colt\" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero \"Tom Ryder\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director \"Jody\" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives \"Colt\" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer \"Gail\" (Hannah Waddingham) in",
            "Colt Seavers is a stuntman, like everyone else in his profession. Like every stuntman, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows, and dropped from heights for the sake of our entertainment. Now, after a near career-ending accident, he must find a missing movie star, unravel a conspiracy, and win back his love while still juggling his regular job.

            "The Fall Guy indeed.\r\n\r\nIts unfortunate to see reasonable acting talent, fall victim to this genuinely unfunny, inarticulate mess of a film. A film that meanders pointlessly from place to place, with no real purpose. \r\n\r\nThe only true upside is a sprinkling of decent musical tracks by hit groups like ACDC and KISS, that work in almost any context.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Thunderstuck (sorry ACDC) by how bad this film is.

            "\"The Fall Guy\" is an action-comedy film directed by David Leitch, starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. It revitalizes the 1980s TV series with a blend of humor, thrilling stunts, and nostalgic nods.

            "I'm disappointed. I was a huge fan of the series back in the day. But the movie didn't really try to capture the spirit of the show. It leans much more heavily towards being a generic romance movie. Although, to its credit, it does subvert quite a few of the romance tropes.\r\n\r\nFor an action movie that's supposed to be an homage to the unsung heroes of cinema, the stuntmen, it falls flat.

I knew nothing else about it, so I can't comment on this in regards how well it adapts the game. As a movie though, I did get the required enjoyment from it.\r\n\r\nSure the story could've been greater, but what's produced kept me watching all the way through - it's a watchable flick.

How can a movie with such complex and elaborate set, costume design and background can have such a bland, forgettable character with such a boring storyline? I suppose it is not the fault of the movie because it follows the story of a video game? Yet it remains true. I think there's too many characters and not enough time to explore each cha",

True, there isn't an original thought in it's hundred minute duration and it does look like a very poor relation to a video-game, but it's \"Mad Max\" meets \"Buck Rogers\" vibe just about entertained me. It's all about \"Lilith\" (Cate Blanchett) who is a renowned bounty hunter charged by gazillionaire \"Atlas\" (Edgar Ramirez) with finding his kidnapped daughter \"Tina\" (Ariana Greenblatt).

To preface, I want to clarify that I know nothing about the Borderlands video games—I’ve never played them, and I have no bias against them. However, I approached this movie with some trepidation, knowing Eli Roth's track record with handling other IPs has been less than stellar.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Borderlands feels like a blatant attempt to rip off Guardians of the Galaxy. The influence is undeniable, but Roth clearly missed what made Guardians",

Dull, humourless, uninspiring, wooden exposition, that vacuously apes what once was.\r\n\r\nFor my money too, much of the cast just don't fit this kind of over the top action genre. As a result a good number of performances feel more than a little awkward.\r\n\r\n",
            "After reading all the bad reviews (some here) of Borderlands, I decided to give it a watch. To be brutally honest, I actually enjoyed it. It’s definitely not a movie I’d watch again, but it was entertaining enough that if forced to choose, I’d rather watch it again over any of the Ant-Man films. Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd just don’t do sci-fi well—especially Paul Rudd. I thought Cate Blanchett’s performance wasn’t bad at all, and frankly, some of the reviews here seem like pure trolling."

When uploaded the video goes viral, so they start a challenge: if the video reaches a certain number of views, they will enter the house again, at night, alone, totally unprotected.

Okay, at least he has a sword from Final Fantasy!'\r\n⁃ Some days before release: \"Wow, what is it? Good rating? Now I'm hooked!\"\r\n⁃ Some minutes after leaving the cinema: \"Ooohhhh........\"\r\n\r\nIn a few words, I didn't like it.

            "Enjoyed this!\r\n\r\n2023's <em>'Wonka'</em> is very good! It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks.

But almost every storytelling decision - from the creation of Sandman to Peter instantly falling in love with his new costume to that thing that was never actually called",
            "This movie is about Spidey's revenge and  transformation to bad Spidey. It has a dark feel to it that I found one of the most appealing factors to this movie. Because we've all gotten used to Peter Parker being \"your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,” having him turn to the dark side for some time and watch him get out of it was a whole new experience.",
            "Tobey Maguire makes such a great Spider-Man, hands down. We've seen him at his best, but in this movie,  we saw him at his worst, and although I must say I wasn't that big of a fan of how cheesy he looked with that emo cut, it was still enjoyable for me watching him beat the \"venom\" out of him.",
            "So much emotion in this movie! What a way to end a trilogy!",
            "The third and final film to one of the few trilogies we have that are actually good. Tobey surely gave a whole new meaning to Spider-Man and set the bar high for the other Spider-Man movies that came out.",
            "I know this is supposed to have a darker tone than the normal Spider-Man movies we see, but I found it more comedic to see Peter take on an entirely new character. Loved it though!",
            "My wife isn't that big of a superhero fanatic but after watching this whole trilogy with me, I can say that she's still not a superhero fan! Still, I know she was able to enjoy the movie and how the creators told the story.",
            "It still puzzles me to this day why this felt like two movies crammed into one.",
            "Now that I think about it, this film just had too much going on. Compared to the first two which were both hyper-focused on just one storyline, Spider Man 3 lacked that distinct characteristic which I know most of us will agree on.",
            "Out of all the Tobey Maguire Spider Man films, this one had the best effects. But with that, the overall quality of the movie in terms of the plot greatly decreased. I wish they would've stuck with the same strategies they had for the first two films.",
            "I was satisfied, but that already was a disappointment. Spider Man 2 was a great sequel and I had high hopes that they would outdo themselves again this time, but sad to say third time's not gonna be the charm for Spider Man.",
            "Although I'd say that Sandman's acting was pretty on point, I still feel like he could've been cut out from the movie and it still would've made sense.",
            "Spider Man 3 is still pretty good but when you compare it with its other two predecessors, you can see that there is a huge step down in the overall quality of the film.",

            "I'm not hating on the studio for doing a bad job on this one but this is just what happens when you try to please everybody. It's such a shame that the original Spider Man franchise had to end like this. I wanted it to be so much more memorable.",

You can't have romance between two main characters, a conflict between best friends, an inner battle with the protagonist, and two villains each having their own storyline all in just one film. It's just spread out too much that no one really gets a chance for character or story development.",

            "This is a bit of a mess of ideas, this film, and to be honest - I think Tobey Maguire has rather outgrown the part.

The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining h",
            "Though I have always been a DC enthusiast, I was intrigued by the idea of the Deadpool movie, and knew I'd end up watching it (I probably see 70% of DC films that are released and maybe 20% of Marvel ones). I enjoyed its definitely postmodern approach--and wish Reynolds' Green Lantern movie had one-tenth the humour and charm that THIS film had.\r\n\r\nIt'll be very interesting to see how comic-book movies are affected, both short- and long-term by its massive success.",

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it complete",

It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less",

            "Although arthouse horror movies really aren’t my thing for the most part, ‘Midsommar’ falls into a strange middle ground where I wasn’t bored but I wasn’t invested either. I feel no need to “finding the mean“ to read theories online, because I simply don’t care.

I have never seen a whodunnit like this before. Seeing this in a theatre was the poppy-poppy-paper of movie-going experiences, because I so enjoyed that. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._",

A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us.\r\n\r\nRian Johnson is a great director, but at times h",

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role.

Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash.

Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash. \r\n\r\nMichael Keaton has done a brilliant p",
            "I do not know how to explain the movie. I think I can say, it looks like a 90s CGI movie that was not done well, it is a nice concept, but really poorly executed. I will give it a 6 being really nice.",
            "The Flash utilises a tried and true concept, that of time travel and its paradoxes but doesn't really deliver anything of consequence. \r\n\r\nThis film doesn't deliver for a variety of reasons. To my mind, the foremost is the lead character. The Flash's over cooked dripiness, unfunny, goofy antics and fall flat humour, can't quite \"sell\" the concept of him as a hero. If the films producers and writers, wanted to know how to develop a more accessible lead character, they should have looked at the se",
            "Come all, let's witness an amazing adventure of action, adventure and sci-fi in the movie \"The Flash\" which will be released on June 16, 2023 in the United States. This movie follows the story of Barry Allen, who when trying to save his family unintentionally changes the future and becomes trapped in a reality where General Zod has appeared and there are no superheroes to turn to. To save the world and return to the future he knows, Barry's only hope is to race for his life. But will the ultimat",
            "“The Flash” has never been one of the most exciting superheroes (here he’s aptly self-described as the “janitor of the Justice League” who always seems to be “cleaning up bat messes”), so it should be seen as an even greater accomplishment that director Andy Muschietti‘s film is as good as it is. By placing an emphasis on the smarter and more emotional side of the story rather than the visual spectacle, the movie is thematically much richer than the customary loud and dumb summer popcorn flicks ",
            "There's some good stuff here and of course a good chunk was reminders of my childhood and fandome of Batman '89 and seeing Michael Keaton back in the role. The humor for the most part was fine but got a bit 'zany' at times, almost too goofy. I did enjoy the cameos which were amusing. It did touch me emotionally due to my personal issues going on right now.\r\n\r\nThat said, this didn't completely work due to, let's say, inconsistencies in quality of the previous DCEU movies, most of them I did like ",
            "I fear I may be turning into some sort of DC fanboy because... I thought this was great.\r\n\r\nLike with <em>'Shazam! Fury of the Gods'</em>, I was not expecting much from these DCEU films as I only decided to watch them so I could catch up on this universe before the <em>'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'</em> finale next month. I guess I was subconsciously anticipating these to be as flat as a pancake due to the suits upstairs focusing on the upcoming DCU. Yet, I've had a terrific time thus far - <em"

            "The movie isn’t for everyone, of course, but it’s a fun ride back to the past with fantastic performances, hilarious comedy and beautiful aesthetics. Tarantino is the one director in 2019 that can get huge names without people referring to his films as “that Leo film“, and I think that’s worth something whether you’re a fan or not. It’s rare for a film like this to be a mainstream release, and in the lacklustre year of 2019 I think it’s about time we got something in cinemas that's original.\r\n- ",
            "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nQuentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of all-time. He has undeniable talent behind the camera, and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year they’re released. In addition to that, he’s also an extraordinary screenwriter, as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves once again. His knowledge of the early decades of film is vast, so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those ",

Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) & Roman Polanski are neighbors with Jay Sebring always hanging around (Emile Hirsch). Meanwhile the Manson Family nutjobs are lurking in the background, prepping to attack. \r\n\r\n“Once Upon a Time",
            "Well, the last 15-minutes were great, the first 2.5 hours on the other hand was... uneventful. I have an interest in Hollywood, more from the 1980s though, so some of the slower scenes still kept my attention, but there's no real plot and minimal character development.\r\n\r\nThat said, DiCaprio and Pitt both give great performances and Margot Robbie of course had her moments, however I could only chuckle during the theater scene when she kicked her bare feet up. Okay, Quentin, lol. **3.0/5**",

It’s both aimless and yet meaningful with the commentary on the new era in Hollywood. The movie pays tribute to old Hollywood, film making, Sharon Tate, stunt work, and actors. This is perhaps Tarantino’s most personal and matur",

But I really enjoyed two of them (Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction). I can now say I liked Once Upon a Time in Hollywood just as much as I did those two movies. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue is sharp and the main characters are sympathetic enough so I cared what happened to them.

Although, this movie is slightly directionless as I was 2/3rds of the way through the movie and had no idea where it was trying to take me.

The third act is so off the walls and crazy that it makes the entire slow burn of the film worth every second.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _88%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

            "This felt disjointed and scattershot for most of the film's runtime, but I enjoyed the way the storytelling hopped around. There was something building and embarrassingly, I caught on awfully late. The three main actors were great. Margot Robbie is just beautiful and likeable. Brad Pitt is cool, tough and caring. DiCaprio's portrayal of the fictional Rick Dalton is the MVP, though. He's such a multi-dimensional character and it would be fun to see more of his Dalton's behind-the scenes antics.\r\n",

Well, eventually - after maybe 2 hours, or so, we get something akin to what I was expecting. The long, ponderous road to this conclusion has been described by some as a sort of \"love story\".

The original movie was atypical, so the success followed it. In my perspective better that should have left as a one-off movie. But as a low budget product, they knew it was going grab back twice, thrice they spent because of the star value and indeed the first film's influence.\r\n\r\nThere is no story, simply based on the usual Hollywood road adventu",

YES, the performances are as good as the Academy says. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is one of my favorite films and I have watched it many, many times. Javier Bardem, makes an excellent screen villain, this guy is really scary, you would not want him chasing you. Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones turn in S",
            "I literally liked the Movie. Its story is outstanding and innovative. However, I wish the ending was more of action scenes than dialogues. \r\nNot to forget that Javier Barden's acting is breathtaking and marvelous. His smile 4:49 is petrifying!",
            "I always figured when I got older, God would sorta come inta my life somehow. And he didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I would have the same opinion of me that he does. \r\n\r\nNo Country for Old Men is directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and the Coen's adapt the screenplay from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harelson, Javier Bardem and Kelly Macdonald. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Roger Deakins.  \r\n\r\n",
            "I watched this for the first time with a few friends as part of an ongoing movie night we shared. I think it was the most violent film we watched together. The plot is taut and somewhat riveting, with great dialogue and acting.  At the same time, for me, it seemed rather bleak. I gradually had the sense it would not end well for nearly anybody. If it weren’t for the Tommy Lee Jones character, I am not sure I would have wanted to stick with it. He provides a sort of balance in the mood of the fil",

No Country is clearly a product of the Coen Brothers' unique charm and style. It boasts some tense shoot-outs, and the uncompromising pursuit of Josh Brolin's character was fantastic.

Tarantino's technique of capturing the painful discrimination against blacks head-on and, on the contrary, making it cathartic in the final scene is brilliant. Starting with the impressive theme song, nonstop violence replaces it, giving us a glimpse into the kaleidoscope of horrific American society.
