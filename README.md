# 🎬 Sentimental Movies  

Ever been let down by a “popular” movie that streaming platforms pushed at you?  
That’s because most platforms optimize for **watch time and engagement**, not whether audiences actually *liked* the movie.  

That’s where **Sentimental Movies** comes in — a discovery platform that ranks films based on **real audience sentiment**, not hype.

## 🔍 The Sentiment-Driven Approach  

Instead of relying on box office numbers or trending lists, we analyzed **thousands of IMDb reviews** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract genuine audience sentiment.  

✅ Pulled **IMDb’s top 2000 highest-rated movies** 🎥  
✅ Processed thousands of user reviews with **NLTK sentiment analysis**  
✅ Assigned each movie a **sentiment score (0–1)** reflecting positivity  
✅ Filtered out **overhyped disappointments** and surfaced hidden gems  

Unlike traditional 5-star ratings, this sentiment score digs deeper into *how people felt* about a movie — whether they found it emotionally powerful, deeply engaging, or just plain disappointing.
